# Love2D Docs

This is an attempt to make the [Love2D wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) look better using [nextra](https://nextra.site/), getting the [docs from here](https://github.com/love2d-community/love-api).

[LÖVE](https://love2d.org) is a framework for making 2D games in the Lua programming language. LÖVE is totally free, and can be used in anything from friendly open-source hobby projects, to evil, closed-source commercial ones.

# Lua

Never used Lua before? It's a really cool language! This manual won't teach you Lua, but fortunately there are other good resources for that.

- [Programming in Lua (first edition)](http://lua.org/pil)
- [Lua-Users Tutorials](http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory)
- [Lua 5.1 Reference Manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/)

# Hello World

This is the full source for 'hello world' in LÖVE. Running this code will cause an 800 by 600 window to appear, and display white text on a black background.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.print('Hello World!', 400, 300)
end
```
